import JSLive from 'react-js-live';

Announcing a new JavaScript Playground for the blog.

<JSLive
  snippets={{
    html: `<h1 class="title">Here is some HTML</h1>`,
    css: `.title {color: red;}`,
    js: `console.log("accompanied by some logs")`,
  }}
  id="snippet"
  mode="html"
/>

This is a live edit panel so you can edit and come up with a live output right here, right now.

You can find the library [https://github.com/BoyWithSilverWings/react-js-live](https://github.com/BoyWithSilverWings/react-js-live)

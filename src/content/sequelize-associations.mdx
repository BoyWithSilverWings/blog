[Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) is an Object relational library (ORM) that helps to communicate between database (Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server) and programming models on the NodeJS end. 

This blog exclusively deals with how to setup associations in sequelize. Primary knowledge of NodeJS, Express and SequelizeJS is recommended.

## Associations

An association (also called a relationship) models the way two classes are connected to each other. 

Sequelize supports three types of associations between their models:
* One to One relationship
* One to Many relationship
* Many to Many relationship

### One to One relationship

![Example of one to one relationship with User and Profile connected to each other](./sequelize-associations/one-to-one.png)

Here, User and Profile share a one to one relationship. A user has a profile and profile has a user associated with it.

## One to Many relationship

![Example of one to many relationship with User and Commments connected to each other](./sequelize-associations/one-to-many.png)

Here user and comments share a one to many relationship. Each user can make multiple comments while each comment is associated with only a single user.

## Many to Many

![Example of many to many relationship with User and Books connected to each other](./sequelize-associations/many-to-many.png)

Here User is marking down Books that he has read. Each user can mark as many books as they want, creating a many to many association between User and Books. Contrary to the earlier scenario with comments, a Book also can be connected to many number of Users.

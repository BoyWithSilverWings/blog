This is part of a series where I try to explain through each of [33 JS Concepts](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts).

This part corresponds to the Double Equal vs Triple Equal.

### Prerequisites

1. [Type Coercion in JavaScript](https://blog.agney.in/type-coercion/)

`==` is known as loose equality.

`===` is known as strict equality.

### What is difference between loose and strict?

Loose Equality performs Coercion.

Strict Equality _does_ not perform Coercion.

Coercion is defined here follows the rules specified in the Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm as defined in the ES Spec.

### Case 1 - Both of the operands are of same types

<JSLive
  id="same-types"
  snippets={{
    html: ``,
    css: ``,
    js: `console.log(
  undefined == undefined,
  null == null,
  NaN == 1,
  1 == NaN,
  NaN == NaN,
  +0 == -0,
  2 == 2,
  -2 == 2
);`,
  }}
/>

Take Aways from here:

1. `NaN` is **not** equal to itself or anything else.
2. `+0` is equal to `-0` (_not that anyone uses them_)

### Case 2 - The operands are null and undefined

<JSLive
  id="null-undefined"
  snippets={{
    html: ``,
    css: ``,
    js: `console.log(
  undefined == null,
  null == undefined,
)`,
  }}
/>

These people are very special and they are coerced to be equal to each other.

Unlike others this is something that has constant applications. There might be functions that you want others to write and take the result from. You have instructed them to return `null` if the result is falsy but they forget. You have not got `null`, but you have got `undefined` in you hands. Instead of writing these an `||` to compare them you can compare the result with `==` to get the exact result you want.

This also means that they are not equal to anything else. If you try `undefined == false`, you are ought to get `false` out of it.

> Don't believe me? Try it out yourself.

### Case 3 - One is string and the other number

<JSLive
  id="string-number"
  snippets={{
    html: ``,
    css: ``,
    js: `console.log(
  12 == "12",
  "12" == 12
)`,
  }}
/>

The string is being converted into a number here. If it is not a number, you will get an `NaN`, which is not equal to anything else anyway (not even itself as we mentioned)

### Case 4 - Boolean and something else

<JSLive
  id="boolean-and-else"
  snippets={{
    html: ``,
    css: ``,
    js: `console.log(
  12 == true,
  true == 12
)`,
  }}
/>

> Huh? Where is the coercion I was promised?

Coercion is still happening, we are not just looking at it the way compiler is. If compiler sees a boolean on either side of the `==`, it converts the boolean into a number and repeats the algorithm. So in our case, `true` gets converted to `1` and Is `12 == 1`, No; and hence `false`

You know what would be right though? `1 == true`, try it.

What if the other side is not a number? Say `"12" == true`, let's break it down:

1. Compiler sees a boolean: `"12" == toNumber(true)` --> `"12" == 1`
2. Compiler sees a string: `toNumber("12") == 1` --> `12 == 1` (Case 3)
3. `false`

### Case 5 - String/Number vs an Object

<JSLive
  id="object-and-else"
  snippets={{
    html: ``,
    css: ``,
    js: `console.log(
  {} == false,
  [] == false,  // Okay
  [[]] == false,  // Hmm..
  [[0]] == false,  // definitely wierd
);
 
const a = {
  valueOf: () => 0,
}
const b = {
  toString: () => "string",
} 
console.log(
  a == false,
  b == "string"
);
 
const c = {
  valueOf: () => 0,
  toString: () => "string",
}
console.log(
  c == 0,
  c == "string", // What?! I was just getting the hang of this.
);`,
  }}
/>

Lots of things here, let's break them down one by one.

If we find an object on either sides of the `==` operator, we try converting it to a primitive.

#### How might we do that?

Objects have two methods defined to do this:

1. `toString()`
2. `valueOf()`

`valueOf` by default returns the object itself, `toString` says `[object Object]`

> More like I'm Groot. But this time, annoying.

Rule 1: These two methods can only return primitives.

> There are no errors if they return other stuff. It just ignores the value.

> I mean, Common! `valueOf` just broke their only rule with it's default value.

1. Empty object is not a falsy value, no coercion here.
2. We have
